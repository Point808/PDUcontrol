# PDUcontrol

### About
Script to control dumb telnet-accessible power strips.  Created with clean output for use in Home Assistant or other automation but could be used as a standalone app as well.  Will require modification to work with other boot bar prompts or output.  There are many other ways to do it that are probably all better but this filled my needs.
